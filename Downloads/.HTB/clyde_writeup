@ HTB

Thank you for considering this challenge as an addition
to your aresenal. I was inspired from the scene in 
mr.robot when he decrypted all of the encrypted data
by cracking his private GPG key. A nice learning experience
with asymmetric encryption and decryption using gpg.

	I was out at the bar tonight with some friends and saw this guy come in, looked like a fed. He ordered a few drinks and then met with a smoking hot lady who he got really fidigty around. He ended up fidgiting his phone, keys and usb out of his pocket as i was getting more drinks right next to him, so while i helpeed him get his stuff i swiped his usb.

	Its been a few hours since i last saw him, he left shortly after that with his friend..On my way home I felt as if i was being watched.. I may just be being paranoid but either waya here is the stuff i got. goodluck..
