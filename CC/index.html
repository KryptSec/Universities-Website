  <h3>Who Must Follow Our Code?</h3>
  <p> We expect all of KryptSec members and faculty to know and follow the Code. Failure to do so can result in disciplinary action, including termination of membership. Moreover, while the Code is specifically written for KryptSec members and faculty, we expect KryptSec affiliates and others who may be temporarily assigned to perform work or services for KryptSec to follow the Code in connection with their work for us. Failure of a KryptSec affiliate or other service or individual to follow the Code can result in termination of their relationship with KryptSec. </p>

Failure of a KryptSec affiliate or other service or individual to follow the Code can result in termination of their relationship with KryptSec. </p>
  <h3>Obey the Law</h3>
  <p>KryptSec takes its responsibilities to comply with laws and regulations very seriously and each of us is expected to comply with applicable legal requirements and prohibitions. While it’s impossible for anyone to know all aspects of every applicable law, you should understand the major laws and regulations that apply to your work.  And remember… don’t be evil, and if you see something that you think isn’t right – speak up!</p>
  <h3>What If I Have a Code-of-Conduct (CC) Related Question or Concern? </h3>
  <p> If you have a question or concern, don’t just sit there. You can contact your officers, your President, or Student Services. You can also submit a question or raise a concern of a suspected violation of our Code or any other KryptSec policy via email at support@mltechi.com. Finally, if you believe a violation of law has occurred, you can always raise that through Student Services or with a government agency. </p>
  <h3>No Retaliation</h3>
  <p>KryptSec prohibits retaliation against any member/faculty here at KryptSec who reports or participates in an investigation of a possible violation of our Code, policies, or the law. If you believe you are being retaliated against, please contact an officer.</p>
  <h3>Integrity</h3>
  <p> Our reputation as an RSO that our members and subscribers can trust is our most valuable asset, and it is up to all of us to make sure that we continually earn that trust. All of our communications and other interactions with our members and subscribers should increase their trust in us. </p>
  <h3>Support Each Other</h3>
  <p>We are committed to a supportive work environment, where members and faculty have the opportunity to reach their fullest potential. KryptSecers are expected to do their utmost to create a workplace culture that is free of harassment, intimidation, bias, and unlawful discrimination. </p>
  <h3>Harassment, Discrimination, and Bullying</h3>
  <p>KryptSec prohibits discrimination, harassment and bullying in any form – verbal, physical, or visual, as discussed more fully in our Policy Against Discrimination, Harassment and Retaliation (Refer to Constitution). If you believe you’ve been bullied or harassed by anyone at KryptSec, or by a KryptSec affiliate (ex. Hashdump) we strongly encourage you to immediately report the incident to your officers, Student Services(SS) or both. Similarly, officers who learn of any such incident should immediately report it to SS. SS will promptly and thoroughly investigate any complaints and take appropriate action. </p>
